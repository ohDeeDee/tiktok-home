  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how this application (“the App”) handles information when interacting with the TikTok API. The App is created and maintained by a private individual (“the Developer”) and is used strictly for personal and educational purposes.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>The App does not actively collect, store, or share personal information from TikTok users. Any data received from TikTok (such as webhook events, usernames, or profile statistics) is used only for testing or demonstration purposes, processed temporarily in memory, and not retained permanently.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>All TikTok data handled by the App is used solely for local testing and non-commercial integration experiments. The data is not saved permanently, shared externally, or used for marketing or analytics.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>No user data is intentionally stored. Temporary data may exist in memory while the App runs but is deleted once the session ends.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App interacts only with TikTok’s official API or webhook endpoints for development purposes. No other third-party services are used.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>The App is used in a controlled, personal environment. No user data is transmitted beyond TikTok’s API and the developer’s local or hosted server.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
